		<h2>My Course Programme</h2>
		<p>The university programme in which I am enrolled is the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.As the name states, Computer Science is generally <br>
			the science of computing.Its a very interesting programme to learn which allows one to explore the world of computing technology and innovations<br>
		    and as far it is concerned this is the world's largest demanding field of technology advancement.The programme also extends one's knowlegde to<br>
		    understand various computing resources and the entire mechanisms behind computers(software and hardware) which enable us to perform vartous tasks.<br>
		</p>
		<p>Personally I enrolled in this programme because I really like computing and also my future goal and plan is to major in system management and<br>
		   maintenance which requires me to understand more about computing and programming. We have about seven courses in this programme but my favourite <br>
		course is Web Programming which generally involves designing websites using various peogramming languages (HTML,CSS,JavaScript,PHP).</p>

		<p>In our university there are various ways in which one's degree may be sponsored, either self sponsored, scholarship or sponsored <br> by the Higher
			 Education Students Loan Board (HESLB). On my side,I am a self sponsored student.</p>
